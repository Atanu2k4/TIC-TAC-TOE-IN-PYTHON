# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Welcome to my Tic-Tac-Toe game project! This project is part of my journey into learning Python programming and getting started with GitHub.

## Overview

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. It allows two players to take turns placing their markers (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their markers in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. If all the spaces on the board are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

## Features

- Allows two players to play against each other.
- Randomly selects which player goes first.
- Checks for winning combinations after each move.
- Detects when the game ends in a draw.
- Option to play again after the game ends.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the `tic_tac_toe.py` file in a Python environment.
3. Follow the prompts to select your marker (X or O) and begin playing.
4. Take turns entering the position (1-9) where you want to place your marker.
5. The game will display the board after each move and announce the winner or draw at the end.
